# Stencil Sucker

PCB stencil fixation using a vacuum cleaner to compress springs that release the stencil once finished. Once the vacuum is removed, the springs quickly push the stencil up, preventing smearing. Adapted from https://github.com/scheffield/stencil-fix. Redrawn in SolidWorks from scratch. Additionally, a version with less holes,  was created to reduce the 3d print time.
